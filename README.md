# The Vue Right Way

### Well, first of all,
#### You must:
- Check out this page: [The Javascript Right Way](http://jstherightway.org/) and immerse yourself into its concepts.

- I recommend you, ALWAYS use JSLINT in your Vue projects and choise [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

#### Recomendations
- If you would like to toggle buttons use, v-show instead of v-if. Why? [About v-show and v-if | Differences](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/conditional.html#v-show)
